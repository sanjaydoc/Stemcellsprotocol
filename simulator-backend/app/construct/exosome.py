"""IV exosome (extracellular-vesicle) delivery designer (Track A/B carrier).

Exosomes are natural lipid nanovesicles (~30–150 nm) that cells use to shuttle
RNA/protein between each other. As an *injectable* carrier they are being studied
because they (a) are low-immunogenicity / self-derived, (b) can be surface-
engineered to home to a tissue, and (c) carry mRNA/protein/small-molecule cargo —
so for the OSK reprogramming payload they sidestep AAV's ~4.7 kb packaging ceiling
entirely (all three factors ride along as mRNA).

This produces a *research delivery spec*, not a validated formulation. Everything
is illustrative — no dose, no clinical claim.
